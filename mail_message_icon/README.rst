Advanced Mail Icons in Chatter
==============================

This simple module adds a few additional mail icons to the chatter.
There are extra colors that amplify a certain status:
if the email was sent, bounced, not sent (server error etc.) or planned.
There's also an additional email information when clicking icon, so the small pop-up window shows up.
Failed emails have extra information about Status in Sending Failures Wizard.
Also, this module allows you to set up a note about newly created meetings,
which will automatically show up in the chatter,
however this requires code adjustments, see the link with an example code below or install mail_message_icon_demo
where such set up has been configured with recruitment app.
