Advanced Mail Icons in Chatter
==============================

This simple module adds a few additional mail icons to the chatter.
There are extra colors that amplify a certain status:
if the email was sent, bounced, not sent (server error etc.) or planned.
There's also an additional toolbar on icon hover, so the small pop-up window
that shows up when you put a cursor on the icon, containing more specific
information of the email, like who's the recipient or what went wrong
when sending an email if it failed. Also, this module allows you to
set up a note about newly created meetings, which will automatically show up in the chatter,
however this requires code adjustments, see the link with an example code below.

Configuration
=============

Configure outgoing mail server.

Usage
=====

#. make outgoing mail server configuration.
#. send some mails.
#. See in the chatters, new icons with statuses.
#. note: that the calendar icons can be shown only after custom implementation in the modules where there is calendar connection.
